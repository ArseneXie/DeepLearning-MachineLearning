# Clustering Approach

In this clustering folder, I just provide some  commonly used clustering approches.
In fact, these approaches can be found in MATALB tool library.

Kmedoid.m → kmedoid.m in matlab tool library.
kmeans_sheng.m → kmeans.m in matlab tool library.    This distance is Euclidean distance.
kmeans_MD_sheng.m → kmeans.m in matlab tool library. This distance is Mahalanobis distance.
FuzzyCmean.m(fuzzy c-means, sometime call fuzzy k-means) → fcm.m in matlab tool library.
